      <h1 class="h1">Acoustic Guitar</h1>
      <p class="p1">Acoustic guitars form several notable subcategories within the acoustic guitar group: classical
        and flamenco guitars; steel-string guitars, which include the flat-topped, or "folk", guitar; twelve-string
        guitars; and the arched-top guitar. The acoustic guitar group also includes unamplified guitars designed to
        play in different registers, such as the acoustic bass guitar, which has a similar tuning to that of the electric
        bass guitar.</p>
        <br>
      <p class="p2">An acoustic guitar is a guitar that produces sound acoustically—by transmitting the
        vibration of the strings to the air—as opposed to relying on electronic amplification (see electric guitar).
        The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the guitar's body, creating sound.
        This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to strengthen the vibrations of the strings.
        The main source of sound in an acoustic guitar is the string, which is plucked or strummed with the finger or
        with a pick. The string vibrates at a necessary frequency and also creates many harmonics at various different
        frequencies. The frequencies produced can depend on string length, mass, and tension. The string causes the
        soundboard and sound box to vibrate, and as these have their own resonances at certain frequencies, they amplify
        some string harmonics more strongly than others, hence affecting the timbre produced by the instrument.</p>
