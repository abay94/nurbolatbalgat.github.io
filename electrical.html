    <h1 class="h1">Electrical Guitar</h1>
    <p class="p1">An electric guitar is a fretted stringed instrument with a neck and body that uses a pickup
      to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals. The vibration occurs when a guitarist
      strums, plucks or fingerpicks the strings. It is sensed by a pickup, most commonly by a magnetic pickup
      that uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar
      is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a
      loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric
      signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add "color" to the sound or change
      the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and "overdrive", with
      the growling sound of the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in
      blues and rock music.</p>
