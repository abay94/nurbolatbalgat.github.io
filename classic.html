    <h1 class="h1">Classical Guitar</h1>
    <p class="p1">Classical guitars, also known as "Spanish" guitars, are typically strung with nylon strings,
      plucked with the fingers, played in a seated position and are used to play a diversity of musical styles
      including classical music. The classical guitar's wide, flat neck allows the musician to play scales,
      arpeggios, and certain chord forms more easily and with less adjacent string interference than on other
      styles of guitar. Flamenco guitars are very similar in construction, but they are associated with a more
      percussive tone. In Portugal, the same instrument is often used with steel strings particularly in its role
      within fado music. The guitar is called viola, or violão in Brazil, where it is often used with an extra
      seventh string by choro musicians to provide extra bass support.</p>

    <p class="p2">In Mexico, the popular mariachi band includes a range of guitars, from the small requinto to the
      guitarrón, a guitar larger than a cello, which is tuned in the bass register. In Colombia, the traditional
      quartet includes a range of instruments too, from the small bandola (sometimes known as the Deleuze-Guattari,
      for use when traveling or in confined rooms or spaces), to the slightly larger tiple, to the full-sized classical
      guitar. The requinto also appears in other Latin-American countries as a complementary member of the guitar family,
      with its smaller size and scale, permitting more projection for the playing of single-lined melodies. Modern
      dimensions of the classical instrument were established by the Spaniard Antonio de Torres Jurado (1817–1892).</p>
